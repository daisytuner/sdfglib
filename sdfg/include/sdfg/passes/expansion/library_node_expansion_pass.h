/**
 * @file expansion_pass.h
 * @brief Library node expansion pass
 *
 * This file defines a peephole optimizer that will find all LibraryNodes with ImplementationType_NONE in the graph
 * and attempt to expand all of them into more baser operations.
 * It internally uses a list of LibNodeExpanders, so there could be multiple alternative variants to expand a given
 * node, but for now it simply redirects to MathNode.expand() to stay more compatible with existing code.
 *
 * The pass tries to isolate the contents of the expansion from the surrounding SDFG as best as possible,
 * handling finding access nodes or moving edges in a generic way. This makes expansions simpler and allows us to
 * upgrade the passes' handling in the future, for example to cut Dataflow into multiple parts to allow for expansion.
 *
 * To achieve this, every Expander is given a context and the block to do preliminary checks, whether it can /
 * wants to expand this node with its properties. Access to src and dest edges may be neccessary,
 * as some LibraryNodes currently infer their data types from other nodes. Access to src and dest nodes however should
 * be avoided, as the pass may change or remove them.
 *
 * In case, an Expander wants to proceed with the expansion, it needs to call one of the available methods on the
 * ExpansionContext:
 *  * replacement_requires_access_nodes()
 *    * The classic way, where every input and output edge is going to be replaced with AccessNodes.
 *    This way, the inputs might be accessed inside newly created loops etc.
 *  * replace_dataflow()
 *    * A simpler way, where the replacement will happen inside the existing DataFlowGraph. In this case,
 *    no access nodes will be touched. The Expander will create its new nodes and define where which original input and
 * output edge will go The generic expansion logic will then check if this is possible or the graph can be changed to
 * make this possible (future improvements here) It might return nullptr, if it does not know how to isolate the
 * LibraryNode Otherwise, if the replacement was started, it must be finished successfully to not leave the SDFG in a
 * possibly broken state.
